# A Hypixel Skyblock Clone
 This is as faithful of a recreation as I can. The project is made for paper 1.21 but should work on Spigot. This is made to finally get good at making plugins and hopefully get a job at Hypixel once I am old enough.

## Current implemented features
- Mobs spawn with a health bar / name tag
- Mobs can get stat values from a config value
- Players can damage mobs with the custom Skyblock damage equation

## Currently working on
- Finishing the health system (Mainly for the player)
- Implementing skills and wisdom stats

## Planned for the future
- Collections
- Tablist
- Sidebar
- NPCs
- Accessories and MP
- Custom Mobs
- Minions
- Pets
- Fishing
- Traveling between islands
- Custom crafting
- Custom anvil
- Custom enchants / upgrades
